##Password Strength Checker
A beginner Python tool that evaluates password strength using length and character variety rules, checks against a small list of common passwords, and provides improvement suggestions.

**How to run**
- Run 'password_strength_checker.py' in Python 3, or open the Google Colab notebook and run the cell to test passwords interactively.

**What I learned**
- Regular expressions for pattern matching, simple scoring logic for vulnerablitles, and how to present security advice clearly.
